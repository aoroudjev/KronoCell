# Phase 1: Core Functionality Features

## 1. Data Input & File Management
- **Folder Selection:**
    - Interface for selecting a folder containing image data.
    - Support for drag-and-drop file selection.
- **File Validation & Ordering:**
    - Validate supported image formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG, TIFF).
    - Automatic ordering of images based on file names (chronological order).
    - (Future: Option for custom ordering based on metadata or user input.)
- **Basic File Explorer (Optional):**
    - Display thumbnails or file names for user confirmation.

## 2. Preprocessing Module
- **Image Normalization:**
    - Apply normalization parameters (e.g., brightness, contrast adjustments).
    - UI controls (sliders, input fields) to adjust parameters.
- **Preview Functionality:**
    - Allow users to select an example image.
    - Real-time preview of normalization effects on the example image.
- **Batch Processing:**
    - Apply the chosen normalization settings consistently to all images.

## 3. Tracking Module
- **Cell Detection:**
    - Implement traditional computer vision techniques (e.g., thresholding, blob detection) for identifying cells.
- **Tracking Across Images:**
    - Track the movement and position of detected cells throughout the image sequence.
- **Data Logging:**
    - Record tracking information (positions, trajectories) for each image.
- **Basic Error Handling:**
    - Log issues during detection/tracking for later review.

## 4. Visualization Interface
- **Image Display:**
    - Display the current image with overlays indicating detected/tracked cells.
- **Navigation Controls:**
    - Provide a slider or similar control for navigating the image sequence.
- **Status Bar:**
    - Show processing progress (e.g., "Processing image 12 of 1000").
- **Basic Interaction:**
    - Simple controls to start, pause, or restart the tracking process.

## 5. Data Output & Storage
- **Annotation Export:**
    - Save tracking data as annotation files (e.g., JSON, CSV).
- **Output Management:**
    - Ensure that output is stored efficiently without duplicating large image files.
- **Logging & Error Feedback:**
    - Provide error messages and logs for file processing or tracking failures.

## 6. Minimal Manual Correction (Optional for Phase 1)
- **User Notifications:**
    - Inform the user if tracking errors are detected.
- **Basic Correction Tools:**
    - (Optional) Allow users to mark or flag erroneous tracking results for future refinement.
