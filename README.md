# KronoCell

A cell tracking application built for local use but easily deployable. Using Electron, this is served locally for easy large datasets to be processed. If local computation is not good enough, this can be easily adapted to a cloud deployment.


## Introduction

## Dev

---
To work on this, the follwing is required:
- Vite with React (Requires Node.js [https://nodejs.org/en/download])
  - Latest version of Vite [https://vite.dev/guide/]
- Rust [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install]
- TBD...

1) Install the required toolings
2) Startup the backend and frontend either manually or, if on windows, run the start.cmd command to spin up individual console windows that will run these for you.This will be superseded with a Docker Compose system.
